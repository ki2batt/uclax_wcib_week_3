        Medium-size shrimp are the perfect size for a twirl of spaghetti shot through with ribbons of squash. Have vegetarians at the table? Omit the shrimp, double the tomatoes and serve with a spoonful of
        <br>part-skim ricotta cheese on top...

            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package directions for al dente.</li>
              <br>
              <li>While the pasta cooks, trim the top and bottom off of each squash. Peel the squash in ribbons into a colander, using a vegetable peeler, turning the squash as you peel. Stop peeling the squash when you only have the center core of seeds left. Discard the core and seeds.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta water, and then drain the pasta over the squash ribbons. Put in a medium bowl and toss to evenly distribute the pasta with the squash ribbons.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Toss the shrimp with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and some pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, spread into a single layer and cook without stirring, until just turning pink around the edges, about 2 minutes. Stir the shrimp, add the tomatoes, garlic and pepper flakes and continue to cook until the tomatoes have softened and the garlic has toasted, about 1 minute. Add the pasta and squash ribbons, broth and the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cook, tossing, until warmed through and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Add the pasta water a bit at a time, if needed, if the noodles seem dry.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Season with additional salt and pepper. Divide among 4 bowls and top with the chives.</li>
